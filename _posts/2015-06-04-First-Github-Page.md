This is my first [Github Page](https://pages.github.com). I was looking for a platform to host static websites, nothing fancy that would require too much back-end work or complicated setups. Looks like Jekyll + Github Pages will allow me to focus more on content than in set up, formatting, etc. That makes me happy. `/bin/bash`
